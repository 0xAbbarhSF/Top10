# GM Golden Master

## Important Notice

### Request for Comments

This is the Golden Master, and once released, only high priority changes and small typos will be fixed.

At this stage, we are asking for

* Translations - we have some teams working already, but do reach out to us if you can help
* Very close review of the wording
* Review diagrams and tables to make sure they are clear and useful
* If risk factors (exploitability, prevalence, detectability, impact) are concise and accurate
* Vulnerability and Scenarios boxes are clear in meaning
* Recommendations must be actionable
* Any OWASP or External links are high quality and agree in concept and tone with the Top 10â€™s content
* CWE links must cover the content discussed in each risk. Do we need to add, change, or remove CWEs? Does the CWE need updating? If so, we have a very small window to work with MITRE to make it better

We strongly urge for any corrections or issues to be logged at GitHub:

* [https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues](https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues)

Through public transparency, we provide traceability and ensure that all voices are heard during this final month before publication.

* Andrew van der Stock
