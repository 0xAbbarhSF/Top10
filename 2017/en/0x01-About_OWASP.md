# O About OWASP

## Foreword

Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure. As our software becomes increasingly critical, complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The rapid pace of modern software development processes makes risks even more critical to discover quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this OWASP Top 10.

Although the original goal of the OWASP Top 10 project was simply to raise awareness amongst developers, it has become the de facto application security standard. The first release candidate received a great deal of push back, which caused a leadership change, involving the community in re-evaluating what the OWASP Top 10 *is*, the methodology, the data collection and analysis, and how we provide transparency and governance over the project. Most of all, the push back showed us how much passion the community has for the OWASP Top 10, and thus how critical it is for OWASP to get the Top 10 right for the majority of use cases.

We have taken steps in this release to firm up the definition of issues, and improve the recommendations to be leading practices that may be adopted as a standard. We encourage larger and high performing organizations to use the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) if a true standard is required, but for most, the OWASP Top 10 is a great start on the application security journey, and now it can be used as a standard for the first time as a supported goal.

Since 2010 the Top 10 have been prioritized by risk, not just by prevalence or any other single metric or factor. In this latest version, we have continued to rank issues by risk based upon community feedback. Our risk model takes in exploitability, pervasiveness based upon 114,000 apps, detectability and technical impact, as measured by recent breaches. You may want to add your own business impacts to each of the OWASP Top 10, and so we encourage internal forking of the OWASP Top 10 to help your appsec program align with ISO 31000 and business imperiatives, as well as improve the recommendations to align with your architecture, platform and integrations. All of our materials are freely available on GitHub, including the data, so please use the OWASP Top 10 rather than try to craft your own internal checklists. 

In the long term, we encourage you to create an application security program that is compatible with your culture and technology. These programs come in all shapes and sizes, and you should avoid attempting to do everything prescribed in some process model. Instead, leverage your organization's existing strengths to do and measure what works for you.

We hope that the OWASP Top 10 is useful to your application security efforts. Please don't hesitate to contact OWASP with your questions, comments, and ideas at our Github repo:

Lastly, we wish to thank the founding leadership of the OWASP Top 10 project, Dave Wichers and Jeff Williams for all their efforts, and believing in us to get this finished with the community's help. Thank you!

## About OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.  At OWASP you'll find free and open ...

* Application security tools and standards
* Complete books on application security testing, secure code development, and secure code review
* Standard security controls and libraries
* Local chapters worldwide
* Cutting edge research
* Extensive conferences worldwide
* Mailing lists

Learn more at: [https://www.owasp.org](https://www.owasp.org)

All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application security require improvements in all of these areas.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. Similar to many open source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, open way.

The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP Board, Chapter Leaders, Project Leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.
