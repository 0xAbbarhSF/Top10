# +RF Details About Risk Factors

## Top 10 Risk Factor Summary

The following table presents a summary of the 2017 Top 10 Application Security Risks, and the risk factors we have assigned to each risk. These factors were determined based on the available statistics and the experience of the OWASP Top 10 team. To understand these risks for a particular application or organization, you must consider your own specific threat agents and business impacts. Even severe software weaknesses may not present a serious risk if there are no threat agents in a position to perform the necessary attack or the business impact is negligible for the assets involved.

A8 and A10 come from survey data, which is discussed in the TBA chapter. The two residual issues that did not have data to be included in their own right were deserialization (514/740) and insufficient logging and monitoring (440/740). The other survey items entered the OWASP Top 10 in their own right.

To understand these risks for a particular application or organization, you must consider your own specific threat agents and business impacts. Even major software weaknesses may not present a serious risk if there are no threat agents in a position to perform the necessary attack or the business impact is negligible for the assets involved.

Some of these have appeared in previous versions of the Top 10, and others have not, including new attack techniques that are being identified all the time.Â  Other important application security risks (in alphabetical order) that you should additionally consider include:
